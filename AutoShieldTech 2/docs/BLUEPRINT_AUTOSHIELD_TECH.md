# AutoShield Tech Blueprint (Merged)

- Public branding: **AutoShield Tech** (no AI mention)
- Internal engine: **AutoProtect**

## Key rules merged
- Companies cannot force AutoProtect for members.
- AutoProtect never reveals itself in external emails; messages go out as the account owner.
- Users text-only; optional Read Aloud. Admin/Manager can optionally use voice later.
- If unpaid for up to 3 months: lock account. On restore: new platform ID + forced password reset.
- Trial option: $19.99 / 30 days (single-user experience).
- Phone number support is a placeholder: later buy a number (Twilio/etc) and route to verified voice agent with member ID.

## What’s intentionally placeholders (partners needed)
- Cards / global spending / currency conversion
- Wires / autopay schedules / payroll tax forms
- Deep integrations to customer infrastructure (connectors)
